7) Scope description
To initiate the whole project (regardless of whether it is a master’s thesis or a research project) we expect you to write a scope description. This will help all parties involved to reach a consensus on the what and how of your project. 
This document should be rather short (1-2 pages) but as the title says provides the scope for all your later steps. It will also help you to overcome writer’s block and the much feared blank page syndrome.
The scope description should address
A (working) title
research project 1 / research project 2 / thesis (or a combination thereof)
A problem (best formulated as a question)
Why is this a relevant / challenging problem ? (Not only for the supervisor but also for the community?)
Why are you the one to solve it? (past experience, …)
How do you think you will solve it? In what direction will you look for a solution
A rough plan (worm's eye perspective)
