# Utility folder

This is a set of external tools (not really for the thesis) for analysis and optimization.

## Utils

In the utils we have a sorting function, that sorts the dataset based on file size. Makes it easier to understand what files are big and small.

Next, we have some other optimization code that simplifies the bigger java files. Only for the things that do not impact the renaming context will be simplified.
Note that this feature will use OpenAI gpt, so in case you want to use this, make sure the right API key are set for you.
