# Master thesis: Renaming identifiers using LLM

## Tools

In the `tools/` folder you can find several tools I made to help you with running this project.
In case you are running this on windows, you can use the `change_java_version.ps1` to switch java versions in case needed.
In linux this is done by changing the `JAVA_HOME` variable.
