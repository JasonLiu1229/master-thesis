planning part needs to be tweaked

waterfall is not good - incremental planning or iterative 
	- small by small
	- make assumptions to check if it fits the planning

Replicate Arno works
	- Test arno works, or make a sort of benchmark

Make my own increments
	- planning steps carefully 
	- make a more thorough planning
	- make a rough planning

---------------------------------------------------------------

Fine tuning models:
	- store code as graph
	- matching the dataset with embeddings store and with existing method
	- Using similarity of other methods to match with our code to make unit test case

GraphcodeBERT: to generate semantic embeddings
GNN: to generate structural embeddings

semantic embeddings - what the method means
structural embeddings - how the method looks like
	- these are stored in embeddings store

Training phase to make embeddings store 
and then we can use this store with matching algo to generate new unit test for new source code

Prompt template and then generate a prompt 
	- different prompts for different LLM 
	- might be relevant for prompt engineering
