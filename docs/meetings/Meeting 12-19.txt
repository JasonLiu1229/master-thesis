Different methodoligies discussed in that paper, mainly focussed on function naming
    - templating, where the name follows a certain format 
    - code convention rules, so LLM names based on those code conventions 
    - Coverage goal based naming, look at the test and see what goal it tries to cover
    - Assertion backword tracing, so only looking at what affects the assert to see what is tested and determine naming
    - LLM assisted with guardrails, so use some things of the code, like assertions and inputs and what error it raises to determine function naming

Many smaller files consists of no identifiers as tests:
    - made a script that checks for them
