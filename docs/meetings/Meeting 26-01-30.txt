Codereader is done and uploaded to pypi
    - show example
    - adding api based runner

Read four papers about readability
    - First paper: Cognitive design elements to support the construction of a mental model during software exploration
        - "Software comprehension depends on the construction of mental models, not on surface-level features of the code."
        - So meaning that it is about how easy it is to understand something and not about just oracle based metrics

    - Second paper: Re-evaluating the Role of BLEU in Machine Translation Research
        - Callison-Burch et al. (2006) show that BLEU:
            - is neither necessary nor sufficient for quality,
            - assigns identical scores to outputs humans judge very differently,
            - fails when multiple valid expressions exist.

    - Third paper: Judging LLM-as-a-Judge with MT-Bench and Chatbot Arena
        - Strong LLM judges align with human judgments at human-level agreement rates
        - LLMs can reason to why something is named like that or why we choose a certain structure
    
    - Fourth paper: G-Eval: NLG Evaluation using GPT-4 with Better Human Alignment
        - From this paper we see that G-Eval works simmalarly to what we want to do with our own tooling
        - G-Eval outperforms BLEU/ROUGE on alignment.
            - "Evaluation improves when we move from surface overlap to semantic reasoning."

Ran a small scale eval using openai api to demonstrate that fixed statistics are useless

Cloud proposal:
    - Benifits for why we need cloud compared to vsc
    - Make a business case that we can not refuse
    - Not long, just one paragraph
