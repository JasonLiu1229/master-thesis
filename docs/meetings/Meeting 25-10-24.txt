Review docker setup
	- docker good

How to choose pipeline / models?
	- Trial and error based, start small and make it bigger based on observations
		- find challenges and problems
		- repeat
	- Start simple
		- RAG for later
		- Look for models that make embeddings, maybe not - look into it more
	- Maybe agentic pipeline - look in to this more
		- Split responsibilities with different LLMs maybe
		- Hard to convince the value of the need that these LLMs are good or not

Should I train OpenAI model or just test it?
	- General purpose to trained model, test it
	- Size of model matters too, so cant be probably compared to research based model
		- Note this down
	- Try the family of LLM from OpenAI
	- Using co-pilot to use other LLMs
		- find out about how to use that
