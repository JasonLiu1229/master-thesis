Went from full file renaming to only renaming the identifiers within the file.
    - so extracting the identifiers -> renaming them -> putting them back in the file
    - prompt engineering was not helpfull

Supercomputer access:
    - https://docs.vscentrum.be/accounts/vsc_account.html
        Master students can also use the infrastructure for their master thesis work. 
        The promoter of the thesis should first send a motivation to hpc@uantwerpen.be and then the generic procedure should be followed (using your student UAntwerpen id) to request the account.
    - might still need to look for cloud options

Remade obfuscator using AST like parser:
    - Originally used regex to find identifiers, but that was not perfect because some special cases were not handled well

Some files take a long time for eval:
    - Optimize for bigger files
        - maybe split in to different ways of computing for bigger files
        - extracting only the needed content
        - for long var declartion like strings, subsititute the string with temp
    - find examples for big files, so we can sort it
