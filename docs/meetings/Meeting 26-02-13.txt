Cloud proposal feedback:
    - if we do full dataset, we should do everything with the full dataset
    - decide if i go parrallel or serial
        - serial and then continue based on the results that we see
        - incremental planning and cheaper
        - add this to the proposal

We need to compare:
    - Arno's data vs mine
    - Add other base model so we can compare with more than only Arno
    - Find models that are better at naming things like coding
        - Claude (last year)
        - GPT family (worst case)

Ran Arno's thing with full new test dataset

Implementing LLM scoring in my own thing

To add testing with local models
    - split pipeline in local runner and api based

Also add partition save for tuner
    - 25%, 50% and 100%
