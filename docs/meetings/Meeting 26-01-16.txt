Ran my first job on 21-12-25 - run actually started running on the 27-12-25

New run on 12-1-25, still in queue 16-01-26

Queueing tuning takes so long

Working on CodeReader - current task while I wait for the model to be tuned
	- Currently still in development
	- LLM readability tester 
	- needs to be verified to actually be reliable
	+ Provide right argumentation 
	+ The scores are not really valuable for the current scoring that is why LLM
	+ LLM already trained so they can already reason in some sense
	+ Look at LLM evaluation frameworks
		- Non determinism - so multiple solutions are correct
		- To compare output to expected output - giving some scoring
		- G-Eval - LOOK IN TO THIS - motivation
			- https://deepeval.com/docs/metrics-llm-evals

Current LLM-renamer
	- Can be improved by adding templating
		- so forced formats for Java
	- Can be improved by dividing steps in to two runs but increases processing time

GPT
	- API key is fixed

What tasks do I need to focus on?
	- CodeReader
